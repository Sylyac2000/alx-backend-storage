## 0x02. Redis basic

## Requirements
* Language: Javascript, Python 3.7 (and C )
* OS: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
* Compiler: python3  (and gcc 9.3.0)
* Version: MySQL  8.0.25
* Style guidelines: [Pycodestyle] (https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle)

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:


* Learn how to use redis for basic operations
* Learn how to use redis as a simple cache


## Synopsis
This repository holds some python projects I worked on at ALX SPECIALIZATION.

## Requirements
* All of your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
* All of your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
* Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
* All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
* All your functions and methods should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
* All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
## Tasks

* 0. Writing strings to Redis
* 1. Reading from Redis and recovering original type
* 2. Incrementing values
* 3. Storing lists
* 4. Retrieving lists
